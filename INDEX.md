## 📱 Sample Application

### Task Manager App
A complete, working mobile application demonstrating:

**Features:**
- ✅ Task creation and management
- ✅ Priority selection with custom radial slider
- ✅ Task filtering (All/Active/Completed)
- ✅ In-memory data storage
- ✅ Clean MVU architecture
- ✅ Cross-platform (iOS & Android)

**What Makes It Special:**
- **Generic**: No business-specific logic
- **Educational**: Well-commented, clear structure
- **Complete**: Full CRUD operations
- **Safe**: No sensitive data or API keys
- **Extensible**: Easy to build upon

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner Track
1. Read [README.md](README.md) - Understand the basics
2. Follow [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) - Get it running
3. Explore `Domain.fs` - See F# types in action
4. Study `Features/TaskList/` - Learn MVU pattern

### Intermediate Track
1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Deep understanding
2. Examine `Root/State.fs` - Master navigation
3. Study `Controls/RadialSlider.fs` - Custom controls
4. Modify the app - Add new features

### Advanced Track
1. Replace `MockData.fs` with real backend
2. Add authentication and user management
3. Implement data persistence (SQLite)
4. Add advanced UI features (animations, gestures)
5. Optimize performance
6. Prepare for production deployment

## 🔑 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. MVU Architecture
```fsharp
// Model: Immutable state
type Model = { Tasks: MTask list; Filter: TaskFilter; IsLoading: bool }

// Update: Pure state transitions
let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | TasksLoaded tasks -> { model with Tasks = tasks; IsLoading = false }, [], None

// View: Declarative UI
let view model =
    ContentPage(
        VStack() {
            for task in model.Tasks do
                taskItem task
        }
    )
```

### 2. Type Safety
```fsharp
type TaskId = TaskId of Guid          // Strong typing
type Priority = Low | Medium | High    // Discriminated unions
```

### 3. Functional Composition
```fsharp
let getFilteredTasks model =
    match model.Filter with
    | All -> model.Tasks
    | Active -> model.Tasks |> List.filter (fun t -> not t.IsCompleted)
    | Completed -> model.Tasks |> List.filter (fun t -> t.IsCompleted)
```

### 4. Async Operations
```fsharp
let mapCmdMsg = function
    | LoadTasks ->
        Cmd.ofAsyncMsg (async {
            let! tasks = TaskApi.loadTasks()
            return TasksLoaded tasks
        })
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## ✅ What This Tutorial IS

✅ Educational sample application  
✅ Best practices demonstration  
✅ Clean architecture example  
✅ Generic, reusable patterns  
✅ Foundation for your own apps  

## 🎯 What This Tutorial IS NOT

Things you probably need to add before publishing this application to real users:

- Authentication/authorization  
- Connected to real backend services  
- More specific business logic  
- API keys or credentials  
- CI/CD pipeline for deploying to e.g. App Center for automated testing

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install prerequisites
dotnet workload install maui

# 2. Navigate to project
cd TaskManagerApp

# 3. Restore packages
dotnet restore

# 4. Run on Android
dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-android

# Or run on iOS (macOS)
dotnet build -t:Run -f net9.0-ios
```
